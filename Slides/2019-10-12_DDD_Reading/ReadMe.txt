For DDD Reading, the slides were significantly modified following feedback from DDD East Anglia.

The core content is the same, so can still use the DDD East Anglia PDF version as an accompanying document for the source code.

However, as the Powerpoint presentation is approx 20MB, I have created a OneDrive share instead of putting into the GitHub repo.

The presentation can be found here:
